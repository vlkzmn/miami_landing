<p>Layout is adaptive and responsive. It works correctly on all screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop). Is implemented using the mobile-first approach.</p>
<p>The code is valid HTML5 and CSS3. In order to decrease user load and avoid code duplication, styles are implemented using Sass (SCSS) including advanced features like mixins, extends, loops etc. BEM methodology is used for naming classes. This naming convention makes the code more readable and understandable, helps to avoid naming conflicts and makes the code easier to maintain and reuse.</p>

# In Conclusion
<p>This project aimed to improve my skills in HTML5, CSS3, Sass (SCSS), BEM methodology, JavaScript, responsive and adaptive layout and build the entire landing page positioning elements using all the tools such as flexbox, grid, media queries, etc.</p>

<p>The main challenge was to combine all the knowledge and skills I have acquired so far and implement a landing page from scratch.</p>
